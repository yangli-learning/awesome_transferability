# awesome_transferability
A list of recent research papers on the computation, analysis and application of transferability in transfer learning. 
(work in progress)

## Ananlytical transferability metrics
Analytical metrics refer to methods that do not need to train the transer network (e.g. fine-tuning) on the target data.  We group the papers by whether they mainly focus on the single-source transfer setting or the multi-source transfer setting.
